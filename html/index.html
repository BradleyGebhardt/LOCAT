            BAME Ciri was a move made by the director and crew of the upcoming Netflix show based off of a series of novels, written by Andrzej Sapkowski, about a mythical fantasy world, filled with monsters, humans and those that kill the
            monsters. Which in turn takes very heavy influence from Polish folk-lore. This in turn means that most polish people at the time would have been majority white. But due to what I can only assume were outrageous quotas that are required
            to be filled, they called for a BAME actress (Black Asian Minoric Ethnicity). Now of course, this sparked a lot of controversy among the fans of the witcher series of books as well as the games (based off of the books). This ultimately
            led to petitions being signed and even went as far as to lead to a few people even boycotting Netflix based on the casting choice. In the end the powers in charge of the show decided to respond to the backlash by casting Freya Allan as
            Ciri, and claiming that she was part of the minority in Poland. There is of course a lot more to it, which will be explored in the later sections.
