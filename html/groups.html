          <p>
            So what exactly is an SJW? Well, in concept it’s rather simple. An SJW is an individual who has a firm belief that we should be living in a society that is free of judgement, racial, sexual, emotional and physical abuse, discrimination
            and
            prejudice. This is quite a dream. One that would require a perfect world. A world that we are very much unable to achieve, simply due to our human nature. But how did it start?
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be chocked up to the Woman’s suffragette movement. This was the first feminist movement, and at the time had good intentions. Women were fighting for the right to vote, the right to not have to wear
            long
            dresses the whole time, a few even wanted to fight in the wars, and so on and so forth. Sadly, this is not the case today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feminism, what was once a movement with clear intentions, has grown into some new beast. A beast that others decided to imitate and create new movements. And so comes the first SJW. A social Justice Warrior. Someone who is also fighting
            for rights, but the rights that they are fighting for and very clear. For example, gay marriage, or transgender rights. They claim to be fighting for those groups, fighting for their rights, but what rights don’t they have? They are
            after
            all, human and are entitled to the bill of human rights. They can do anything that anyone else can.
            So it seems what they fought for was to allow transgender men to compete in women’s competitions, where they very clearly have the upper hand.

            Let’s look at Netflix. The blame cannot entirely be placed on them as they were most likely pressured by tropes in society created by groups like feminists and SJW’s fighting for ‘racial diversity’. This is of course not a bad thing,
            but it tends to be forced into areas where it doesn’t make sense. The producers of the show were most likely afraid of being told that they are ‘not diverse enough’ (even though the world of the witcher deals with extremely heavy racial
            discrimination), so they sent out the casting call. This did create a different kind of outrage, one that made those SJWs happy, but did something much worse they angered the fans.

            Fans are an interesting group of people. They tend to act rather emotionally when it comes to what they love, often to varying degrees. From mild perturbed-ness to raw burning rage and fury. Netflix got close to the latter and would’ve
            have had a situation similar to that of the Simpsons and the recent debacle going on there, wherein SJWs chose now as the right time to point out that a character in the show that has been running for years, is racially insensitive and
            stereotypical. It’s absolutely preposterous.

            Luckily the most that fans did this time round was boycott Netflix and cancel their subscription, or angrily take flight to twitter and voice their emotions in strongly worded tweets of only 280 characters, resulting in the lead writer
            taking a break from the social media platform. In the end they banded together and did the impossible. They got Netflix to change the casting call and cast Freya Allan in the role. But you know, they cast Henry Cavil as one of the main
            characters, but we’ll ignore that.
